# MSTU5013Final
Final Project for MSTU 5013 Lisa &amp; Furry Friends
This is a web app intended for the user tp introduce lisa more furry friends and play (treat or prank) with them. The user can type in a new furry friend's information on the left hand side of the app (name, type of animal, and a URL input box to updata a picture of the animal). After the user hit submit, the data will be instantaneously passed into the database and show up on the screen (right hand side). After clicking the "Submit" button. the user will also get an alert message to instruct them how to use this page. Animals on the right-hand side of the page are sorted by their "love" value. The one with a higher "love" appears on the top. The added animal will have a "love" property of 5 by default. The user can increase the value of "love" by giving the furry friend "treat" via clicking "Got Treat?" or reduce the value by clicking "Got Prank". When the value of love is greated than 9, the background color of this animal's profile picture will change into hot pink. If the animal's love value is lower than 3, its profile picture's background color will turn into grey.
Update on August 13th: A new "filter" feature is added to the app, so that the user can filter which furry friend to interact with based on the furry friend's name.
